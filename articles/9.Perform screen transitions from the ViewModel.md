# Perform screen transitions from the ViewModel

This library provides the EnkuToolkit.UiIndependent.Services.INavigationService interface for screen transitions from the ViewModel and its implementation in the following class.

- EnkuToolkit.Wpf.Services.AbstractFrameNavigationService
- EnkuToolkit.Wpf.Services.MainNavigationWindowNavigationService

AbstractFrameNavigationService is an abstract class used for screen transitions in a Frame on a Window.
MainNavigationWindowNavigationService is a class used to perform screen transitions in NavigationWidnow.

It is also assumed that they will be registered in a DI container and used in the ViewModel using constructor injection.

## Preparation for screen transitions in a Frame on a Window

To perform screen transitions in a Frame on a Window, it is necessary to create a class in the application project that extends AbstractFrameNavigationService.

There is one property that must be overloaded in the AbstractFrameNavigationService.

> ```c#
> protected abstract Frame TargetFrame { get; }
> ```

This property should be implemented in such a way that it returns the Frame you wish to use for screen transitions.
(example)

```c#
public class MainFrameNavigationService : AbstractFrameNavigationService
{
	protected override Frame TargetFrame
    {
        get
        {
            var app = (App)Application.Current;
            var mainWindow = (MainWindow)app.MainWindow;
            return mainWindow.MainFrame;
        }
	}
}
```

Then register the class created with INavigationService to the DI container.

```c#
services.AddTransient<INavigationService, MainFrameNavigationService>();
```

## Preparation for screen transitions with NavigationWidnow

There is no need to create a class if the window specified in App.Current.MainWindow is NavigationWidnow.
As shown below, INavigationService and MainNavigationWindowNavigationService only need to register NavigationWidnow in the DI container.

```c#
services.AddTransient<INavigationService, MainNavigationWindowNavigationService>();
```

## How to perform screen transitions in ViewModel

The ViewModel of the page being displayed should be able to use the INavigationService object registered in the DI container above using constructor injection.

```c#
public class Page1ViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private INavigationService _navigationService;
    
    public Page1ViewModel(INavigationService navigationService)
    {
        _navigationService = navigationService;
    }
}
```

The INavigationService object injected with the constructor above has the following methods.
By using them, screen transitions can be performed from the ViewModel.
