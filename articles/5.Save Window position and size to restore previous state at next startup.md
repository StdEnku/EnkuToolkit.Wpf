# Save Window position and size to restore previous state at next startup

This library includes a function that saves the window's position, size, and WindowState as a Json file when the window is closed, and reads the file the next time the window is launched and reflects it in the window.
To enable this functionality, attach the StateSavePath attachment property of the EnkuToolkit.Behaviors.WindowExtensionBehavior class to the Window class and specify the save file path there.

```xaml
<Window ~Ellipsis~
        xmlns:et="https://github.com/StdEnku/EnkuToolkit"
        et:WindowExtensionBehavior.StateSavePath="./WindowStateSaveData.json">

    ~Ellipsis~
</Window>
```
